TurtleThread is a tool inspired by `TurtleStitch <https://www.turtlestitch.org/>`_, and powered by
`PyEmbroidery <https://github.com/EmbroidePy/pyembroidery>`_, that lets you program an embroidery machine with a Turtle
interface. 

If you are moving to TurtleThread from Python Turtle, take a look at the
`intermediate tutorial <intermediate/whatsnew.html>`_. For beginners, it may be helpful to visit the `beginners 
introduction <https://turtlethread.com/en/intro/index.html>`_ by the original developers of TurtleThread.

.. admonition:: Which version of TurtleThread is this?
   :class: important
   
   This is a **fork** of the original TurtleThread by AppVenture, NUS High's Computer Science Interest Group. The
   original was developed by Marie Roald and Yngve Mardal Moe. You can visit that version 
   `here <https://turtlethread.com/en/>`_.
