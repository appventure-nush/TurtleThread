TurtleThread is a tool inspired by `TurtleStitch <https://www.turtlestitch.org/>`_ and powered by `pyembroidery <https://github.com/EmbroidePy/pyembroidery>`_ that lets you program an embroidery machine with a Turtle interface. 

If you are moving to TurtleThread from Python Turtle, take a look at the `intermediate tutorial <intermediate/whatsnew.html>`_.
