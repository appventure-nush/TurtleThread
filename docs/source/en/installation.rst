Installing TurtleThread
=======================

Installing TurtleThread should be just as easy as any other Python library!

Firstly, ensure Python 3 is installed. We support most versions newer than Python 3.6.

As this is a fork of TurtleThread, it must be installed via the following command, and **NOT** from PyPI.

``pip install git+https://github.com/appventure-nush/TurtleThread``

If you have previously installed TurtleThread (from PyPI, by the original developers), it is recommended to uninstall the previous version first.

``pip uninstall turtlethread``
